# Advent_of_Code_2024

At this repository you will find my solutions at challenge [Advent Code 2024]()https://adventofcode.com/2024.

The solutions of each day will be uploaded in separated folders. In each folders you will find the input for each puzzle and two differents JavaScript files, each one resolving both problems that are proposed everyday of the challenge.

I am currently learning Rust, so my solutions could not be so perfect. I am using this challenge to learn a new programming lenguage for me.

I encourage you to try and solve the problems! It could be so fun and enriching. It is more exciting if you try this with your friends (you can create a leaderboard and compete).

I will try to solve the problemns on a daily basis, though it is possible that some days I get stuck on an specific problem.

## Repository content
In this repo, you will find, separated by day folders:

- Input file of each day, in a .txt format.
- Rust files (.rs) for each solution.

Happy Christmas coding! üéÑ üíª ‚ùÑÔ∏è
